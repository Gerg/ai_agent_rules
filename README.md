# Gerg's Signature® Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Overview

These are my general instructions/rules for AI/LLM coding agents. At time of
writing I primarily use these with Claude 4.5 Sonnet.

## AGENTS.md

Learn more about the spec: https://agents.md/

I use AGENTS.md in a non-standard way. The intended use case is akin to a
README.md file, namely rules that are tied to the particular code repository
and checked in alongside source code.

Instead, I maintain a global AGENTS.md file with generic rules, symlink it into
each individual repository, and do not check it in. This has a number of
weaknesses, including:
1. It's tedious to maintain the symlinks
1. It conflicts with any repo that already has an AGENTS.md file

Ideally, I'd want something like an `~/AGENTS.md`, which automatically applies
globally, but I'm not aware of anything like that. The closest is probably
Cursor user rules, but they only apply to Cursor and are configured via the
Cursor IDE, rather than a configuration file that can be easily edited, checked
into a VCS, etc.

### Provenance 

These rules primarily originate from the following:
1. https://www.simplermachines.com/nats-current-prompts/
1. Human-generated by myself, in response to AI agent behavior
1. Generated by AI coding agents, when asked to retrospect on coding sessions

## Skills

The `skills/` directory contains reusable knowledge documents for specific tasks.

See [skills/README.md](skills/README.md) for details.

### Provenance 

These skils are primarily AI-generated, distilled post facto from agent
coding sessions where the skill was performed.
