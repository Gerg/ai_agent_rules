# AI Agent Skills

A collection of skills for AI agents using progressive disclosure, covering story writing, code review, issue tracking, and skill development.

> **Note:** These skills were created with AI assistance and are provided as starting points. Review and adapt them to your specific context, team conventions, and project requirements. Examples use generic patterns and may need customization for your codebase.

## Standards and Licensing

These skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard, an open format originally developed by Anthropic and implemented by Cursor, Claude, and other tools. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

**License**: Skills without their own LICENSE file are covered by the repository's MIT license (see top-level LICENSE file). The [Skill Writing Skill](skill-writing/SKILL.md) incorporates content from [Anthropic's skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md) and is licensed under Apache-2.0 (see `skill-writing/LICENSE`).

## How Skills Work

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always loaded (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - Loaded when skill is relevant (~500 lines)
3. **Reference files** - Loaded only when needed (as requested)

This keeps context usage efficient. For example, when writing a Jira story about Cloud Foundry API:
1. Agent loads `story-writing/SKILL.md` (321 lines)
2. User mentions Jira → Agent loads `references/jira-markup.md` (457 lines)
3. User mentions CAPI → Agent loads `references/cloud-foundry-api.md` (529 lines)

Only the needed content is loaded, not all 1,771 lines.

### When to Use Which Skill

**Writing a user story:**
- Enable `story-writing/`
- Agent will ask about tracker (Jira, GitHub, etc.)
- Agent will ask about domain (Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Agent loads only relevant references

**Reviewing a pull request:**
- Enable `pr-review/`
- Enable `agent-issue-tracking/` (for tracking findings)
- Agent will determine which validation techniques to use
- Agent loads relevant references as needed

**Creating a new skill:**
- Enable `skill-writing/`
- Agent will guide you through the process
- Agent loads reference materials as needed

**Tracking work:**
- Enable `agent-issue-tracking/`
- Use for local, agent-coordinated work
- Use for postponing work to later sessions
- Agent loads tool-specific reference (e.g., tk, beans, beads) as needed

**Creating a command:**
- Enable `command-writing/`
- Agent will guide you through creating a simple, focused command
- Agent helps distinguish when to use commands vs skills

## Quick Start

### Writing a Cloud Foundry API Story in Jira

1. Enable `story-writing/` skill
2. Tell the agent you're writing a Jira story about a CAPI endpoint
3. Agent loads:
   - `story-writing/SKILL.md` (universal principles)
   - `references/jira-markup.md` (Jira formatting)
   - `references/cloud-foundry-api.md` (CAPI patterns)

### Reviewing a Pull Request

1. Enable `pr-review/` and `agent-issue-tracking/` skills
2. Ask agent to review the PR
3. Agent loads:
   - `pr-review/SKILL.md` (core process)
   - `agent-issue-tracking/SKILL.md` (tracking)
   - `agent-issue-tracking/references/tk.md` (tk commands)
   - `pr-review/references/test-validation.md` (if bugs suspected)
   - `pr-review/references/consistency-patterns.md` (if new features added)
   - `pr-review/references/scope-validation.md` (if detailed AC exists)

### Creating a New Skill

1. Enable `skill-writing/` skill
2. Ask agent to help create a skill
3. Agent loads:
   - `skill-writing/SKILL.md` (core principles)
   - `references/TEMPLATE.md` (template)
   - `references/CREATION-PROCESS.md` (step-by-step guide)
   - Other references as needed

## Adding New Skills

When creating new skills, follow the progressive disclosure pattern:

### Core Skill Structure
```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Universal principles + navigation (~500 lines)
└── references/        # Loaded as needed
    ├── tracker-a.md   # Tracker-specific content
    ├── domain-b.md    # Domain-specific content
    └── framework-c.md # Framework-specific content
```

### Examples of New Skills

**System-specific skills:**
- `story-writing/references/kubernetes.md` - Add K8s patterns to story-writing
- `story-writing/references/aws.md` - Add AWS patterns to story-writing

**Tracker-specific skills:**
- `story-writing/references/github-markdown.md` - Add GitHub formatting
- `story-writing/references/linear-formatting.md` - Add Linear formatting

**Language-specific skills:**
- `pr-review/references/python-patterns.md` - Add Python review patterns
- `pr-review/references/go-patterns.md` - Add Go review patterns

**Note**: Each reference file should focus on one tracker/domain/framework and be loaded only when relevant.

## Principles for Skill Development

1. **Keep skills focused** - One concern per skill
2. **Use progressive disclosure** - Split variants into references/
3. **Avoid duplication** - Reference other skills or reference files
4. **Provide examples** - Show, don't just tell
5. **Be prescriptive** - Give clear guidance, not just options
6. **Stay generic** - Avoid project-specific details
7. **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** - Split content into references when needed
