# Skill Creation Process

Step-by-step guide for creating a new skill from scratch.

## 1. Identify the Need

Ask:
- What knowledge needs to be captured?
- Is this a foundation, domain, or system-specific skill?
- Does this overlap with existing skills?
- Will this be reused across contexts?

## 2. Define the Scope

Determine:
- What's included in this skill
- What's excluded (belongs in other skills)
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Target audience

## 3. Choose a Structure

Select based on content:
- **Reference**: Comprehensive coverage (e.g., Jira markup)
- **Pattern-based**: Common patterns (e.g., API story types)
- **Sequential**: Step-by-step process
- **Conceptual**: Principles and philosophy

## 4. Draft the Content

Follow the structure:
1. Title and purpose
2. Prerequisites (if applicable)
3. Core principles
4. Main content (organized logically)
5. Examples throughout
6. Common mistakes
7. Integration guidance

## 5. Add Examples

For each major concept:
- Provide concrete examples
- Show both good and bad approaches
- Include realistic scenarios
- Keep examples focused

## 6. Review for Quality

Check:
- [ ] Single, clear purpose
- [ ] Composable with other skills
- [ ] Prerequisites stated
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Common mistakes covered
- [ ] Integration guidance included
- [ ] No duplication with other skills
- [ ] Generic (not project-specific)
- [ ] Clear, actionable guidance

## 7. Update the README

Add the new skill to:
- Skills list
- Composition matrix
- Quick start guides
- Related skills sections

## Skill Maintenance

### When to Update
- New patterns emerge
- Common mistakes are discovered
- User feedback identifies gaps
- Related skills change
- Best practices evolve

### How to Update
1. Identify what needs to change
2. Check impact on dependent skills
3. Update content
4. Update examples
5. Review integration guidance
6. Update README if needed
7. Notify users of changes

### Versioning (Optional)
For major changes, consider:
- Dating updates in changelog
